All of our Bettadelic images can be bought as NFTs.  You've probably heard of NFTs, and they can be controversial.  NFTs are a tool, and like most tools, they can be abused.  We at Bettadelic want to be ethical and transparent.  Therefore, when you buy an NFT, this is what you get.

By default, all of Bettadelic's images are not licensed to anyone.  Using them could violate copyright.  However, once anyone buys the associated NFT with the Bettadelic image, the image immediately becomes licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).  This means anyone, not just the NFT buyer, can copy, redistribute the image in any medium or format, for any purpose, even commercially.  The only thing you'll have to do is provide appropriate credit, and can't distribute derivative works.

The holder of the NFT after buying it mainly has it to show "I was the one who unlocked this image to the public."  It provides no other benefit.  The holder could try re-selling it if they wanted to, but the new buyer wouldn't get much other than another asset in their wallet.  Maybe someday we'll do something cool for our NFT holders, but don't expect that anytime in the near future.

## Rationale

### Why a Creative Commons License for Everyone?

We originally were going to plan for whoever holds a Bettadelic NFT is licensed to use the associated image for any purpose.  But, legally, this may not hold water, depending on who you ask.  If we sold an NFT to person A, we enter a contract with person A saying "you are allowed to license this image."  However, what happens if person A sells the NFT to person B, or worse gets stolen?  We did not actively work with person B via them buying an NFT from us.  So does person B get the rights to the NFT even though we never entered a contract directly with them?  Or does the contract get passed along when person A transfers the NFT to person B?

Rather than dealing with that legal landmine, once someone buys the NFT, the NFT gets licensed to _everyone_ as long as they follow the Creative Commons license terms.  That way, it doesn't matter is person A transfers, or worse, loses the Bettadelic NFT.  They can still use the associated image forever because the license is universal for everyone!  The only thing they'll lose upon transferring the NFT is proof that says "I supported this artist, and made this image publicly available!"  While some may find sadness in losing an NFT, it is not the end-of-the-world.

The last reason why is because this promotes [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) while also allowing for a way for an artist to be compensated.

### Why Make NFTs to Begin With?

The first (and slightly cynical) reason is because if we didn't, an imposter may have.  We didn't want someone making NFTs of our bettas, scam users, and the users think it was us.

The second reason is to have a way to support us, and for us to keep making art.  Server space and bandwidth are not free.  Crypto does help pay the bills.

The third reason we are free-and-open-source advocates.  A lot of Bettadelic is a thought-experiment of can NFTs be used to promote free-and-open-source licenses such as the [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/), while also providing a way for an artist to be paid for their work.  Because buying an NFT makes the associated image a Creative Commons License, it not only allows for a way for our images to become free-to-use for the public, but also allows for artist compensation.

### Why Algorand?

[Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/) is the blockchain that powers the NFT infrastructure.  While [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is the blockchain most associate with NFT's, Algorand seemed to be a better fit.

One very valid criticism of cryptocurrencies is they are not environmentally friendly.  [Proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work) block chains such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum use a lot of power to keep their block chains running.  Algorand is [Proof-of-Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake), and is therefore a lot more environmentally friendly.  Algorand even claims they are carbon-negative.

Algorand transaction fees are inexpensive at just 0.001 Algorand per transaction.  So if the price of an Algorand was $1, it would be a fraction of a penny to make transactions.  Ethereum, meanwhile, is more expensive.

Algorand [claims](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/algorands-core-technology-in-a-nutshell) they are un-forkable.  A fork, being, the Blockchain diverges into two different chain.  A famous example is when the [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) was hacked, and the Ethereum blockchain was forked to undo the hack.  The original, unforked, blockchain is now called Ethereum classic, while the forked blockchain continues to be called Ethereum.  If Algorand was forked into AlgorandA and AlgorandB, and someone bought a Bettadelic NFT on AlgorandB, while we use AlgorandA, what happens?  Legally, do we need to honor the AlgorandB buy?  Having an (almost) un-forkable blockchain solves this problem.

Lastly, Algorand is fast.  Like really fast.  Like, transactions are cleared in seconds while other blockchains can sometimes take minutes.

### Why use a Blockchain to begin with?

Buying or selling things on blockchains can be anonymous if you are careful.  In reality, however, once someone knows your wallet ID, they can track everything you do on the blockchain.  This is why the idea to put personal information such as medial records in the block chain is ridiculous.  However, in Bettadelic's use case, the lack of anonymity is an advantage.  Because the selling of the NFT is public, even if our site goes down or we turn evil and claim the image was never licensed as Creative Commons, there is public proof in the block chain saying otherwise.  If we were to use PayPal or some similar service, then that proof of purchase isn't public, and can disappear.

The other, less exiting reason, was to learn more about how blockchains worked.

### Can Bettadelic's Images be Deleted?

Another common criticism about NFTs is the NFT itself is not the art being sold, it is just a token of metadata associated with the art that can be transferred.  Usually the metadata contains a URL to the art itself.  But, what happens if the URL to the art goes away?  The NFT is now pointing to literally nothing.

While can't guarantee Bettadelic will be around forever, we do have multiple ways to make sure our images will be.  For one, we upload all of our images to [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System), meaning that multiple servers can contain the image.  In addition, all of our images are uploaded to [https://archive.org/](archive.org), so they are backed up there as well.  Hopefully the combination of these backups mean that our Bettadelic images will stay around for a long time!
